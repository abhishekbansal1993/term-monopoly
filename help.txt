THE BOARD\n
The file used specifies the board spaces and their order; the cost to buy and\n
develop properties as well as their rent at each development stage; the decks\n
and cards in each deck; and the amount of money each player starts with, gets\n
for completing a loop around the board, and the fee required to leave jail.\n
\n
THE OBJECT OF THE GAME\n
Buy and develop properties in order to collect money from other players. You win\n
when all other players have gone bankrupt.\n
ON YOUR TURN\n
Before you roll to move, you may complete the following actions as many times\n
as you would like on your turn:\n
  Sell a property: If selling a developed property, the development stage will\n
      decrease by 1 and you will receive half of the cost paid to develop to\n
      that stage. If selling an undeveloped property, the property will be\n
      given to the bank and you will receive half of the cost to buy that\n
      property.\n
  Develop a property: You may develop properties of Color groups when you own\n
      all the properties in that group. Properties of the Railroad group\n
      have a development stage based on the number of properties in the group\n
      that you own, and cannot be developed by paying money. You must have\n
      enough money to pay for the development of the property you select.\n
  Make a trade offer: You may offer an amount of money and a set of properties\n
      to another player, and request an amount of money and set of properties\n
      from another player. The request will then be set to the other player to\n
      accept or decline.
Once you decide to roll, the rest of your turn depends on what kind of space\n
you land on:\n
  Property space:\n
    - If the property is owned by the Bank, you can decide to buy the property\n
      for the displayed cost (you must have enough money to pay the cost) or to\n
      not buy the property.
    - If the property is owned by another player:
      - If that other player is in jail, you do not owe any rent.
      - Otherwise, you must pay the rent. You may sell properties in order to\n
        have enough money to pay rent. If after selling properties you still do\n
        not have enough money to pay rent, you must go bankrupt (lose the game).\n
    - If you own the property, you stay without paying rent.\n
  Transaction space:\n
    You may be required to pay money to the bank, or you may receive money from\n
    the bank. You may sell properties in order to have enough money to pay the\n
    bank. If after selling properties you still do not have enough money to pay\n
    the bank, you must go bankrupt (lose the game).\n
  Card space:\n
    Draw a card. The card will be of the following type:
    - The card may instruct you to go to a property space, in which case you\n
      move and your turn continues the same as if you had landed on that space\n
      (see Property space above).\n
    - The card may instruct you to conduct a transaction with the bank.\m
      (see Transaction space above).\n
    - The card may be a Get Out Of Jail Free card, which you hold onto to use\n
      when you are in jail.\n
  Jail (just visiting):\n
    If you land on the jail space, you are just visiting (not in jail) and your\n
    turn ends.\n
  Go To Jail:\n
    You are sent to jail (in jail), and your turn ends.\n
IN JAIL\n
While you are in jail, you cannot collect rent from players who land on your\n
properties, you cannot sell or develop properties, and you cannot make trade\n
offers (although you may be offered trades by other players which you can accept\n
or reject). On your turn you may do the following actions to attempt to leave jail:\n
  Use Get Out of Jail Free Card: If you have a get out of jail free card, you\n
    can use it to leave jail, and you get to start your turn from just visiting\n
    jail.\n
  Pay Fee: If you have enough money, you can pay a fee (specified by the game\n
    which you are playing) to leave jail. You leave jail and your turn ends.\n
  Roll: If you roll doubles (two of the same number), you leave jail and move\n
    the number of spaces that you rolled. Your turn proceeds based on which\n
    space you land on (see above). If you do not roll doubles, you remain\n
    in jail and your turn ends.\n
ROLLING DOUBLES\n
If you roll two of the same number (doubles) and you are not in jail, you get\n
to take another turn. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you\n
are immediately sent to jail.\n
